Oopsie is linux based OS of hackthebox starting point.Let's start hacking it

i. Enumeration:
===============

# nmap -sC -sV -p- --min-rate=1000 vvv -oN <ip>
-> It will give us two ports open.
22 - SSH
80 - Apache web server

Let's visit the web-page for any interesting factor
-> View the page source and we got an interesting page for login with an username admin, alternatively we can use burpsuite passive scan for content-discovery
-> http://<ip>/cdn-cgi/login
-> Login into webpage using email admin and the password we got on previous machine MEGACORP_4dm1n!!
-> Notice the uploads section which is inaccessible by normal user.
-> So, we need to escalate our privilege to access that page.


ii. Gaining Access
===================
-> We will use burpsuite intruder to enumerate the user id
-> Once the intruder stops, we will look for super admin id which is on id=30
-> Now that we know user role,its id and access id, let's change the cookies value with the give credentials
-> We are now superadmin
-> Upload the reverse shell of php and start a netcat listener on your local ip
-> After uploading the file, we have to access our file which we don't know where it is stored.Thus we will use ffuf
  # ffuf -u http://<ip>/FUZZ -w <wordlist> -c -v
  
  -> we got an interesting folder named uploads 
  -> let's visit that page but wait what we are forbidden to access that page, Now problem we will see whether our shell.php is present on it or not
  -> when we visit http://<ip>/uploads/shell.php, We got shell
  
  iii. Privilege Escalation
  ==========================
  
 -> Let's first make our shell stable
  python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash');"
  - It will make our shell stable
  
  Now that we are on right track.Let's see if we can find any interesting stuff in cdn-cgi page which is in /var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login/
  -> we have db.php file which contains username robert and password  M3g4C0rpUs3r! and database named garage.
  -> Switch to user robert using above credentials
  -> visit /home/robert directory for the user flag
  
  After getting user flag let's go for root flag,running the id command shows us that user robert is member of group bugtracker.Let's see what we can enumerate
  # find / -type f -group bugtracker 2>/dev/null
  -> Well we got a file path /usr/bin/bugtracker with suid set
  -> let's have a look into the strings of bugtracker
  #strings /usr/bin/bugtracker
  - We can see cat binary being used there. So, we can abuse that functionality to gain access to the root.
  follow the following steps:
    export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
    cd /tmp
    echo '/bin/sh' > cat
    chmod +x cat
    
    Now,when we run the binary we get root access
   #/usr/bin/bugtracker
  #id
  Goto /root folder and copy the flag
  
 Note: There is a .config directory which contains a filezilla folder which might be useful for us to let's copy the credentials of this one to our notes
 username: ftpuser
 password: mc@F1l3ZilL4
