Pathfinder is also an windows based operating system for our starting point lab of hackthebox.It's time to enumerate to find out interesting stuff on this machine.

i. Enumeration:
===============
#nmap -sC -sV -vvv -T4 --min-rate=1000 -oN pathfinderscan <ip>
-> Scanning the machine gives us 19 ports open where we can find that some of them are interesting for our purpose.
Port No. 88 for kerberos authentication
Port No. 389 for LDAP, which is a domain controller
Port No. 5985 for WinRM
